# Intelligent Agent Routing System
The LMOS Agent Router library allows to route user queries to the most suitable agent based on their capabilities, using four complementary strategies:

- **LLM-based routing**: Utilizes a LLM to select the most suitable agent based on a given user query and a list of agentâ€™s capabilities.
- **Vector-based routing**: Performs a semantic vector search to compare the user query with available agent capability examples, identifying the closest match based on score rankings.
- **Hybrid routing**: Combines LLM-based and vector-based approaches. It first attempts to find a matching agent via semantic search. If no confident match is found,
the LLM is consulted with the agent capabilities from the vector search.
- **RAG-LLM-based routing**: LLM-based agent routing with RAG. Relevant agent capabilities are first retrieved using semantic vector search, then injected into the LLM prompt to provide context-aware, to select the most appropriate agent.
